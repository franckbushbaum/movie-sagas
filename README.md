# Project Name

<b>Weekend Movie Page! ðŸŽ¥ <b>
    
Click a movie to see the genres it falls into and a description of it.

## Description

The goal was to practice sending data from server to client and vice versa using reducers, as well as an attempt at styling a page.  I enjoy these projects when I get the methodically follow the data from one place to the next, injecting it out of a file, into another and so on... As time goes by I can imagine doing this over increasingly complex applications to bring them to life.
